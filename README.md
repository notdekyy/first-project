This Python code creates a simple, in-memory command-line train booking system. It uses a list of 50 Booking objects to manage seats. The system allows users to show available seats, book a seat by collecting name, age, and route details, cancel a booking and print a ticket for confirmation. All data is temporary and is lost when the program exits.
